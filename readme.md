Dungeon Scroller
================

Dungeon Scroller is an experimental game based on what I think is a rather nice pun, don't you?

It's just a simple little game in which you control your little explorer-character who is _crawling_ a maze-like dungeon with lots of gold and traps...only **by scrolling the page!**

This game uses the animated **1-bit Roguelike** sprites from **Oryx**' wonderful [**LOFI Fantasy**](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=8970.0/) art-set.
