Dungeon Scroller
================

Dungeon Scroller is an experimental game based on what I think is a rather nice pun, don't you?

It's just a simple little game in which you control your character, a traditional fantasy adventurer, delving a maze-like dungeon with treasures, traps*, and monsters*...only by scrolling the page.

This game uses the animated **1-bit Roguelike** sprites from **Oryx**' wonderful [**LOFI Fantasy**](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=8970.0/) art-set.
